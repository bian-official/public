**Contribute**

1. Sign in to GitHub with your _username_
2. Click the 'Fork' button in the upper right corner. This creates a working copy of the repository that you can download and change.
3. Install the necessary Git client tools, for example, Download the Git client for your operating system here https://git-scm.com/downloads and run it.
4. Clone the forked repository you created to your local computer by using the git clone command. It will look something like this:
    git clone https://github.com/username/bian-official _myrepository_
    where _username_ is your GitHub username and _myrepository_ is a name you pick for the repository on your computer.
5. Create a branch to add any new features:
    git checkout -b _mybranch_
    where _mybranch_ is your new branch.
6. Add any new features to _mybranch_
7. The next step would be to stage, commit, and push the changed files back to your 'forked' repository on GitHub. You would be able to use _git add_, _commit_, and _push_ commands. Additional detailed information can be found here: https://git-scm.com/docs
8. Go to your forked repository on GitHub and submit a Pull Request by clicking the 'Pull Request' button
9. BIAN will review the changes proposed in your Pull Request, in the BIAN Working Groups with it's members. BIAN might then come back to you with questions / clarifications / suggestions for ammendments. If these changes are approved in the BIAN Working Groups, they will be used to enhance the BIAN standards, and released as part of scheduled future releases. 
10. You are of course welcome to maintain your own fork, as your own flavour of implementation of the BIAN standard.
