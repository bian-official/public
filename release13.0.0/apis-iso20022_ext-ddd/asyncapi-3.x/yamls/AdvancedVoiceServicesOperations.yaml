            A particular point in the progression of time defined by a mandatory
            date and a mandatory time component, expressed in either UTC time
            format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ), local time with UTC offset format

            Note on the time format:

            1) beginning / end of calendar day

            00:00:00  -  the beginning of a calendar day

            involved parties shall agree on the maximum number of digits that
            are allowed.
