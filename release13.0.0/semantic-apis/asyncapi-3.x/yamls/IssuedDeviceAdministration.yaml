    BIAN Service Domain (expanded with the BIAN BOM) | This service domain
    administers the issuance of authentication tokens to customers and third
    party service providers. Tokens here include physical devices such as cards,
    fobs, readers and intangible 'devices' such as passwords and secret
    questions. Administration includes version tracking, replacement and
    duration/frequency limits. Specific product/service access permissions may
    be associated with an issued token when appropriate
