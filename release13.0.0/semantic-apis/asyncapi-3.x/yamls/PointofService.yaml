            The term Report is mostly used as communication about a particular
            subject matter, often in the form of an official document, after
            thorough investigation or consideration by an appointed person or
            body.


            A document containing information organized in a narrative, graphic,
            or tabular form, prepared on ad hoc, periodic, recurring, regular,
            or as required basis. Reports may refer to specific periods, events,
            occurrences, or subjects, and may be communicated or presented in
            oral or written form. (Business Dictionary)
