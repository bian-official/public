            An evaluation whether a party or system is allowed to do something.


            The consent given by a participant (or a third party acting on
            behalf of that participant) in order to transfer funds or
            securities. (ECB)


            Authorization is a mechanism by which a computer system determines
            whether to allow or deny specific action to a user. Authorization is
            often controlled by rather complex rules and algorithms, usually
            specified as part of an access control model. Authorization often
            follows (and required) authentication, however, authentication and
            authorization are two separate mechanisms. In rare cases,
            "authorization" is understood as a process of allowing access,
            granting permissions or giving approval. Such as "authorization" of
            a request to join a group. (ISO/IEC 24760-1:2019 IT Security and
            Privacy)
