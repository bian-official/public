            An object classified as something of value.

            It is some tangible or intangible thing that the bank has ownership
            and/or influence over and has one or more inherent uses or purposes
            that create commercial value

            Comment

            BIAN has defined the likely assets found in any bank and uses this
            approach to isolate the specific types of asset that are acted on by
            the ServiceDomains. The role or purpose of each and every
            ServiceDomain is to apply its specific functional pattern to
            instances of one type of asset.

            Is the tangible or intangible item that can have associated
            'replacement' value/worth and purpose/use for which the bank has
            ownership or some level of control. It is exploited/leveraged in the
            execution of business through the application of some business
            behavior/control as effected by a ServiceDomain. Some asset types
            are obvious for example a machine or building, some are intangible
            but easily identified such as knowhow, knowledge, relationships,
            reputation. Some are less obvious - most common is the 'capacity to
            perform' type which applies to many BIAN Service Domains. For
            example in the case of product fulfillment and support activities
            like party authentication the asset is the bank's possession of the
            capacity to perform these activities the combination of the
            people/processes/systems to execute if you will...
