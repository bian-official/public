      description: ">\r\n* `FinancingLease` - The long-term lease of a capital asset. To the lessee, a capital lease is the same as owning the asset. Accounting rules require that the leased asset and the present value of the lease payments be recorded on the lessee's balance sheet. For the lessor, a capital lease is treated as a sale of the asset.\nhttps://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/capital+lease\n\nA capital lease is a contract entitling a renter to the temporary use of an asset, and such a lease has the economic characteristics of asset ownership for accounting purposes.\nThe capital lease requires a renter to book assets and liabilities associated with the lease if the rental contract meets specific requirements.\nAn operating lease is different in structure and accounting treatment from a capital lease. An operating lease is a contract that allows for the use of an asset but does not convey any ownership rights of the asset.\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitallease.asp\n\n\nA finance lease (also known as a capital lease or a sales lease) is a type of lease in which a finance company is typically the legal owner of the asset for the duration of the lease, while the lessee not only has operating control over the asset, but also some share of the economic risks and returns from the change in the valuation of the underlying asset. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_lease\n\nFinancial Leasing is an alternative way of financing whereby a licensed leasing company (the Lessor) purchases an asset on behalf of its customer (the Lessee) in return for a contractually agreed series of payments which usually include an element of interest. The lessor maintains ownership of the asset while the lessee enjoys the use of the asset for the duration of the lease agreement, usually accompanied by an option to buy the asset at the end of the contract. The lessee bears all costs and risks associated with the use of the leased asset.\nhttps://www2.deloitte.com/cy/en/pages/financial-services/articles/finance-leasing.html\n\r\n* `OperatingLease` - Short-term, cancelable lease. A type of lease in which the contract period is shorter than the life of the equipment, and the lessor pays all maintenance and servicing costs.\nhttps://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/operating+lease \n\n\nAn operating lease is a contract that permits the use of an asset but does not convey ownership rights of the asset. \nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatinglease.asp#:~:text=An%20operating%20lease%20is%20a,on%20a%20company's%20balance%20sheet.\r\n"
