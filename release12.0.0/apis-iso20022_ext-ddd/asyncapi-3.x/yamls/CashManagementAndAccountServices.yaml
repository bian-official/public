                A date time identifies a date and time of day to various common
                resolutions: year, month, week, day, hour, minute, second, and
                fraction of second. (UN/CEFACT)


                A particular point in the progression of time defined by a
                mandatory date and a mandatory time component, expressed in
                either UTC time format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ), local time
                with UTC offset format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sss+/-hh:mm), or
                local time format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sss). These
                representations are defined in "XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes
                Second Edition W3C Recommendation 28 October 2004" which is
                aligned with ISO 8601. (ISO20022)

                Note on the time format:

                1) beginning / end of calendar day

                00:00:00  -  the beginning of a calendar day

                24:00:00  -  the end of a calendar day

                2) fractions of second in time format

                Decimal fractions of seconds may be included. In this case, the
                involved parties shall agree on the maximum number of digits
                that are allowed.
