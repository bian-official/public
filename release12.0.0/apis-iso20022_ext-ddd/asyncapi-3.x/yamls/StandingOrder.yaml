  title: Standing Order
  description: >-
    BIAN Service Domain (expanded with the BIAN BOM) | Customers can issue
    standing orders to the bank. In most cases this is for the execution of a
    periodical payment, but there are other standing instructions like, sweeping
    balances at end of month, topping off excess funds for a current account,
    etc.

                Guy's Definition: I see a financial facility as any type of
                ongoing arrangement so a current account, credit card or even
                a loan account are all financial facilities in that they
                persist over multiple possible transactions. Basically I think
                most banking products fall into two main categories either: a
                financial transaction like a payment, a trade; or a financial
                facility.

                A measuring state on which movements in value or amounts of
                assets, rights and obligations are registered.


                Comment: 

                It is a bookkeeping instrument holding the amount or value of
                something by registering the movements in plus and min when
                events happen which have an impact on the position.

                The term "account" is usually associated to an accounting or
                bookkeeping concept to hold the financial or stock state of a
                business concept. An account will typically group the debit and
                credit entries for a specific aspect of the business resulting
                from transactions,

                Often accounts are represented as a T-account which is a visual
                aid used to depict an account. Above the top portion of the T
                would be the account title. On the left-side of the base of the
                T would be any debit amounts; on the right-side would be the
                credit amounts.

                A commonly used bookkeeping method is the double-entry method.
                This means that every transaction has at least 2 movements. If a
                customer pays 100 € in cash, there is

                a decrease in the amount that the customer owes to the company
                (the customer position is decreased)

                an increase in the amount that the company has in cash (the cash
                position is increased)


                An account can be assigning to one or more ledgers. A ledger is
                a group of accounts for a certain purpose. If there is need for
                multiple ledgers because of multiple purpose, an account can
                perfectly well assigned to multiple ledgers. When Ledgers are in
                real physical books, this is not possible. When ledgers are
                digital, accounts can be grouped into multiple groups at the
                same time. This practice is very rarely taught into courses for
                accounting, but in digital accounting, it is common practice.

                stock account of a shop, cash register, bank account, financial
                accounting account, customer account, supplier account, ...

                suppliers. This account is managed usually in a General Ledger 

                Supplier Account X, is an individual account keeping the balance
                of the amounts to pay by the organisation to an individual
                supplier. The balance is the result of the financial movements
                related to an individual supplier. This account is managed
                usually in a sub-ledger.
