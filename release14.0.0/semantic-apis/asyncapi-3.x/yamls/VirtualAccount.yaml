            slightly different roles:-


            At the Debtor Payer Level 

            The debtor provides the reference/narrative when initiating the
            payment. 

            Purpose:to explain what the payment is for e.g., Invoice 1234,
            August rent. 

            This is usually optional, but very useful for reconciliation.



            At the Creditor Payee Level 

            The same reference is transmitted along with the payment message and
            shown to the creditor when funds are received. 

            Purpose:allows the creditor to match the payment to the correct
            invoice, order, or account.
