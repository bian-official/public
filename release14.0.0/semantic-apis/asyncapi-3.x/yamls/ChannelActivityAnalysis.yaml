    BIAN Service Domain expanded with the BIAN BOM | This service domain tracks
    and analyzes channel activity to support relationship development, to detect
    unwanted behavior, possible fraud, and to constrain channel use as necessary
    for example tracking usage frequency and cumulative transaction amounts
    within a period
