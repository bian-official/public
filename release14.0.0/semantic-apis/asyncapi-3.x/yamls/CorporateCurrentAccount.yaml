The limit is calculated as an arithmetic sum in value of the bilateral flows exchanged between the two parties. The net bilateral limit can be expressed as a debit or a credit balance.\r\n* `Indirectbilateral` Limit is a maximum value set by a direct participant with respect to its indirect participant. The limit represents the maximum amount the indirect participant can use to settle its operations.\r\n* `Global` Maximum value set by either the transaction administrator or by a member for the participation of a member in the system.

            slightly different roles:-


            At the Debtor Payer Level 

            The debtor provides the reference/narrative when initiating the
            payment. 

            Purpose:to explain what the payment is for e.g., Invoice 1234,
            August rent. 

            This is usually optional, but very useful for reconciliation.



            At the Creditor Payee Level 

            The same reference is transmitted along with the payment message and
            shown to the creditor when funds are received. 

            Purpose:allows the creditor to match the payment to the correct
            invoice, order, or account.

The credit provided can be secured using securities already held by the buyer “collateral stocks” or the securities that are being purchased “collateral flows”.\r\n* `Unsecuredcredit` Limit is related to a cap amount granted by a national central bank or a settlement bank, but generally unsecured outside of the market infrastructure.\r\n* `Externalguarantee` Limit is related to a cap amount granted by a national central bank or a settlement bank."
