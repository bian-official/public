                A card network are networks of issuing and acquiring banks
                through which payment cards of some certain brand are processed.
                two types of card networks can be pointed out, namely, credit
                card associations (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, Amex, etc.) and
                PINless debit card networks (NYCE, PULSE, Maestro, Interlink,
                Cirrus, etc.).


                Card networks are financial services companies that enables,
                processes and settles payments between card issuing banks and
                merchant banks worldwide. Examples are Visa, MasterCard,
                Discover, RuPay etc.


                A card network is a system of connecting merchants and card
                issuers.  A middle person that collects funds from card issuer
                and pays it to the merchant.  Visa and MasterCard are examples
                of card networks.
