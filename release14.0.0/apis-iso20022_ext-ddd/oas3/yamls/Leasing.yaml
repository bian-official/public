                At the Debtor (Payer) Level 

                The debtor provides the reference/narrative when initiating the
                payment. 

                Purpose: to explain what the payment is for (e.g., Invoice 1234,
                August rent). 

                This is usually optional, but very useful for reconciliation.



                At the Creditor (Payee) Level 

                The same reference is transmitted along with the payment message
                and shown to the creditor when funds are received. 

                Purpose: allows the creditor to match the payment to the correct
                invoice, order, or account.

                At the Debtor (Payer) Level 

                The debtor provides the reference/narrative when initiating the
                payment. 

                Purpose: to explain what the payment is for (e.g., Invoice 1234,
                August rent). 

                This is usually optional, but very useful for reconciliation.



                At the Creditor (Payee) Level 

                The same reference is transmitted along with the payment message
                and shown to the creditor when funds are received. 

                Purpose: allows the creditor to match the payment to the correct
                invoice, order, or account.

                At the Debtor (Payer) Level 

                The debtor provides the reference/narrative when initiating the
                payment. 

                Purpose: to explain what the payment is for (e.g., Invoice 1234,
                August rent). 

                This is usually optional, but very useful for reconciliation.



                At the Creditor (Payee) Level 

                The same reference is transmitted along with the payment message
                and shown to the creditor when funds are received. 

                Purpose: allows the creditor to match the payment to the correct
                invoice, order, or account.

The credit provided can be secured using securities already held by the buyer (“collateral stocks”) or the securities that are being purchased (“collateral flows”).\r\n* `Unsecuredcredit` - Limit is related to a cap amount granted by a national central bank or a settlement bank, but generally unsecured outside of the market infrastructure.\r\n* `Externalguarantee` - Limit is related to a cap amount granted by a national central bank or a settlement bank."
