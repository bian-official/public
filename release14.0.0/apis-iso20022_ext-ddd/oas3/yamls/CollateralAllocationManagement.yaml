                all kinds of agreements. An Agreement can be subtyped from the
                perspective of various aspects of interest. One can classify the
                agreement from the perspective of format type (e.g., verbal
                agreement, written agreement). Other one can classify agreement
                based on duration like short-term agreement or long-term
                agreement.
