The credit provided can be secured using securities already held by the buyer “collateral stocks” or the securities that are being purchased “collateral flows”.\r\n* `Unsecuredcredit` Limit is related to a cap amount granted by a national central bank or a settlement bank, but generally unsecured outside of the market infrastructure.\r\n* `Externalguarantee` Limit is related to a cap amount granted by a national central bank or a settlement bank."
